    <h3>
      Data Generation
    </h3>
    <p>
      The data used in the visualization is generated inside a jupyter Notebook: <span class="code">dataset_generation.ipynb</span>. 
      We used the python library <span class="code">sklearn</span> to train the Machine Learning Network (MLN).
    </p>
    <img src="resources/trainMLN.PNG" alt="train MLN" />
    <p>
      We split the data into training and test set and trained a simple Neural Network.
    </p>
    <img src="resources/create_grid.PNG" alt="create Grid" />
    <p>
      Here we generate our grid of feature combinations. We generate a range of feature 
      values and combine them using <span class="code">np.meshgrid</span>. We stack the resulting 
      grid so it creates a 2D array where each row represents a point in the grid, and the columns
      represent the values of the two features.
    </p>
    <img src="resources/predict_probabilites.PNG" alt="Predict Probabilities" />
    <p>
      We use this grid to predict a probability vector for each entry. This probability
      vector will later be used for our weighting during the Kernel Density Estimation.
      At last we create a header while writing the data into a file.
    </p>
    <h3>Visualization</h3>
    <p>
      For simplicity, this implementation is contained entirely inside one
      HTML-file, with inline JS: <span class="code">src/index.html</span>. This is also possible because D3 can be
      imported from a remote URL with no real performance loss for our use-case.
      This page documents the different procedures inside the HTML-file that are
      used to create the visualization.
    </p>
    <img src="resources/support_functions.png" alt="support_functions" />
    <p>
      In addition to the "main"
      <span class="code">render_graph()</span> function, there are various
      support/helper functions used to compute various operations.
      <span class="code">getProbsFromMousePos()</span> will be covered below,
      the rest can be seen in the image above.
    </p>
    <img src="resources/options_dict.png" alt="options_dict" />
    <p>
      The most important function is <span class="code">render_graph()</span>,
      where a lot of things happen: first, the current options ("settings") are
      read from the corresponding HTML elements. In addition, the dictionary
      for the JSON DSL is created here.
    </p>
    <img src="resources/read_data.png" alt="read_data" />
    <p>
      Then, the data from the selected file is loaded and parsed, and we ensure
      the format is correct.
    </p>
    <p>From there...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the raw data array is split into a grid (of the two features) and a
        probability array (probability of a class per-point on the grid)
      </li>
      <li>scaling parameters are computed</li>
      <li>and the canvas for D3 is set up, including axes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For each of these steps, the respective areas are marked with comment
      blocks in the source HTML file.
    </p>
    <img src="resources/compute_contours.png" alt="compute_contours" />
    <p>
      After the canvas is set up, the contour edges are computed and later added
      to the canvas. This (and the following computations) happens once per
      class, as they all need separate contours to be computed.
      This function <span class="code">d3.contourDensity()</span> takes the 2D grid
      as input to first filter the data with a Kernel Density Estimation and then 
      generates the contours. We provide a weighting function so that the resulting
      scalar field is weighted according to the probability vector of the respective
      class. We also give the size of the plot, the width of the kernel (bandwidth),
      the size of the cell during marching squares (cellsize) and the thresholds
      for the contour generation (threshold).
    </p>
    <img src="resources/add_to_svg.png" alt="add_to_svg" />
    <p>
      The path elements are then appended to their respective svg elements. If
      enabled, halos are added in the same manner here. In addition, we add
      mouseover event handlers here that enable the tooltip functionality when
      hovering over the plot.
    </p>
    <img src="resources/inverse_scale.png" alt="inverse_scale" />
    <p>
      To get the correct probability data for any given grid position, we need
      to use the previously computed scale to map back from pixel coordinates to
      the "original" feature space. We also need to use a "custom"
      closest-element-in-array function to choose the best approximate
      probability entry for the hovered position from the original data array.
    </p>
    <img src="resources/legend.png" alt="legend" />
    <p>
      The legend is also added to the plot, for all the classes in one step.
    </p>
    <img src="resources/sort_contours.png" alt="sort_contours" />
    <p>
      Countours are then sorted according to their significance
      ("weight"/value).
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the <span class="code">render_graph()</span> function
      configures the plot according to some of the options.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The HTML elements will not be covered here, as they are rather
      self-explanatory/self-documenting and are best referenced from the source
      HTML file.
